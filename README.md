[![Build ARQ Benchmarks with CMake](https://github.com/wjgra/arq-benchmark/actions/workflows/cmake-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wjgra/arq-benchmark/actions/workflows/cmake-build.yml)
Further details TBC! In short, this project relates to the [Automatic Repeat Request](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_repeat_request) method for sending data over unreliable networks. The rough goal is to a) write a basic ARQ library for sending packets over UDP connections and b) compare this with both TCP connections and an existing ARQ library, KCP, in a series of performance benchmarks.
